# Command Line Workout

1. Write a command to print the string `Use " man echo"` _including the quotation marks_; i.e., take care not to print `Use man echo`. **Hint:** Use double quotes in the inner string and wrap the whole thing in single quotes.
2. By reading `man sleep` figure out how to make the terminal "sleep" for 5 seconds before running another command (maybe `echo 'Hello, World!'`)
3. Execute the command `sleep 5000`. Now, realize that's well over an hour so you'd better cancel that!Type 
4. What is the sequence of commands to: 1) Create an empty file called `foo`; 2) Rename it `bar`; 3) Copy it to `baz`
5. What is the command to list only the files starting with "b" in the current directory? **Hint:** Use a wildcard
6. Remove both `bar` and `baz` using a _single_ `rm` command. **Hint:** Check if those are the only two files in the directory starting with "b"
7. Create a file `hello.txt` containing the text "Hello, World!" using `echo` and a redirect `>`
8. Write a simple shell script that greets the user. **Hint:** The current user is stored in the `$USER` environment variable in most shells
